git init	: Initializes a git repository – creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or 
		  in an existing project. 

git clone	: Makes a Git repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original 
		  location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions.
		  Example: git clone <<git URl>>.

git add		: Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. 
		  Example: git add .

git rm		: Removes files from your index and your working directory so they will not be tracked.
		  Example: git rm filename.

git commit	: Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to 
		  it and sets the branch to point to that new commit. Examples: git commit -m ‘committing
     		  added changes’ git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit’

git status	: Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list 
		  out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not 
		  yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing). 
		  Example: git status # On branch master # # Initial commit # # Untracked files: # 
		  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) # # README nothing added 
		  to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
